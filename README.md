# 💬 Chatbot in C++ Generated by ChatGPT

## 📚 Overview

This project is a C++ implementation of a Chatbot generated by ChatGPT. The Chatbot is designed to engage in interactive conversations with users, providing responses based on the input it receives. It leverages natural language processing and machine learning to understand user queries and generate meaningful replies.

## ✨ Features

- **Natural Language Understanding:** The Chatbot utilizes advanced natural language processing techniques to comprehend and interpret user queries accurately.
- **Contextual Responses:** It generates responses that are contextually relevant and meaningful, taking into account the ongoing conversation.
- **Machine Learning Integration:** The Chatbot is trained on a large dataset using machine learning algorithms to continually improve its conversational abilities.
- **Extendable and Customizable:** The codebase is designed to be easily extendable and customizable, allowing developers to add new features or modify the Chatbot's behavior.

## 🚀 Usage

### 📋 Requirements

To run the Chatbot, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang)
- CMake build system
- ChatGPT library (available at: `https://chatgpt-library.example.com`)

### 🏁 Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the Chatbot:

1. Clone the project repository: ` https://github.com/Utkarssh11/Chatbot-Generated-by-ChatGPT`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd chatbot-cpp`
3. Build the project using CMake: `cmake . && make`
4. Run the Chatbot executable: `./chatbot`

### ⚙️ Configuration

You can customize the Chatbot's behavior by modifying the configuration file located in `config.json`. Adjust the parameters according to your requirements.

### 💡 Examples

Here are a few examples of how to use the Chatbot:

```cpp
// Initialize the Chatbot
Chatbot chatbot;

// Start a conversation
chatbot.start();

// Get user input
std::string userInput = getUserInput();

// Generate a response
std::string response = chatbot.generateResponse(userInput);

// Display the response
displayResponse(response);

// Continue the conversation
while (chatbot.isRunning()) {
    userInput = getUserInput();
    response = chatbot.generateResponse(userInput);
    displayResponse(response);
}

// End the conversation
chatbot.stop();
